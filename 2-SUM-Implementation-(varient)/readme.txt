Implementation of variant of 2-SUM algorithm in C.
--------------------------------------------------
Provide an input file containing 1 million integer both positive and negetive as shown in sample input file. The program computes target value t in the interval [-10000,10000] such that there are distinct number of x, y in the file that satisfy x + y = t.
[as well as implemented basic hash table and heap]
