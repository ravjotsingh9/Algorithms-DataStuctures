Implementation of kasoraju Algorithm in C.
----------------------------------------------------
Provide an input file containing edges of a directed graph as shown in sample input file.Vertices should be labeled as positive integers from 1 to 875714. The program will display the 5 largest strongly connected components using kasoraju algorithm.
